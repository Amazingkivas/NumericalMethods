Questions:
1. How to store matrixes?
2. How to implement solvers interface due to chosen decision?

Marks:
1. If difference between implementations of DirichletProblemSolver::solve will be unconsiderable,
   we can remove spesializations for solve and use GridType template param right inside solve 
   to adjust conduction.
